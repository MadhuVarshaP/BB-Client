# BountyBridge

## Project Overview

**BountyBridge** is a revolutionary decentralized community aid platform designed to connect community members by allowing them to post and complete tasks (bounties) such as tutoring, food delivery, small repairs, or pet sitting. This platform utilizes advanced Web3 technologies, including **Scroll** for scalable transactions, **Worldcoin** for unique identity verification, and **The Graph** for transparent task indexing and reputation tracking.

### Features

- **User Verification**: Ensures that only real, unique individuals can create or claim tasks, preventing bots and duplicate users.
- **Task Creation & Completion**: Users can post small community tasks and attach bounties (tokens) that are held securely during task completion.
- **Reputation & Transparency**: Every task and user completion status is indexed, allowing users to view the reputation of task claimants.
- **Fast Payments**: Payments for completed tasks are processed through Scroll's scalable smart contracts, ensuring low fees and quick settlements.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Smart Contracts**: Scroll
- **User Verification**: Worldcoin API
- **Data Indexing**: The Graph

## How It Works

1. **User Verification**: Users verify their identity using Worldcoin.
2. **Task Creation**: Users post tasks with bounties on the platform.
3. **Task Claiming**: Verified users can browse and claim available tasks.
4. **Task Completion**: Users complete tasks and receive their bounties.
5. **Reputation Tracking**: Task statuses and user reputations are indexed for transparency.
